1) what is gulp ? 
------------------
   
   Gulp is a task runner that uses Node.js as a platform. Gulp purely uses the JavaScript code and helps to run front-end tasks and large-scale web applications.
   It builds system automated tasks like CSS and HTML minification, concatenating library files, and compiling the SASS files.
